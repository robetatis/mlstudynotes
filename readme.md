## **Setup**

- We have a dataset of input-label pairs $X = (x_i, y_i)_{i=1}^n \subset \mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}$ ($\mathbb{R}^d$ is the space over which $x$ is defined and $\mathbb{R}$ is the space over which $y$ is defined).
- This dataset is assumed to be acquired via *iid* sampling from a joint probability distribution $\mu(x, y)$, defined in space $\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}$
